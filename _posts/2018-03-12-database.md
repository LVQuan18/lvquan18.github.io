A training dataset with processed SAX MR sequences of 145 subjects from clinical environment is used for model learning and validation. For each subject, 20 frames are included for the whole cardiac cycle. All ground truth values of the above-mentioned LV indices are provided for every single frame. More details about the training dataset can be found in the document of the DIG-Cardiac dataset. With the training dataset, we encourage the participants to report the performance of their algorithms with N-fold cross validation, where the following configuration are used : N=3, the number of each folds are (49, 48, 48); N=5, the number of each folds are (29, 29, 29, 29, 29); and N=7, the number of each folds are (21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 20, 20). In such a way, we can have initial impression of the algorithmsâ€™ stability.
The training dataset is available via email.

A test dataset with processed SAX MR sequences of 30 subjects will be provided to participants according to the challenge schedule for algorithms assessment and ranking. The processing procedure is the same as that in the training dataset. For each subject, only the SAX image sequences of 20 frames are provided, while their ground truth values are not.
